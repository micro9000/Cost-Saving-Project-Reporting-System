# ESavings

* ESavings is a web based solution that enable anyone in the factory to raise cost saving ideas. Each idea will be routed to Department Cost saving lead for validation in terms of project validity, computing the impact, assigning actions, assigning categories (e.g.: cost-savings and cost-avoidance projects) before it goes to Finance team for final approval at Factory level.
* Helps increase cost savings awareness in the factory that ensures cost spending at minimum
* This web application is mainly use and maintain in OSPI Tarlac

## Reason why I created this repo on my own account

* I design the structure of this project since this is one of my individual project at OSPI Tarlac
* I want to use it as reference for future C# ASP.NET MVC projects
